## Project Overview

This project is all about predicting house prices. I am going to explore a range of machine learning algorithms and deep learning models. My goal is to provide accurate predictions based on the features of residential properties.

## Dataset

I am working with the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset. This dataset contains information about various residential properties, including features like the number of bedrooms, size, and location. I also have corresponding sale prices. This dataset is provided in a CSV format.

## Data Preprocessing

Before I dive into building models, I need to prepare my data. Data preprocessing includes:

- Handling missing values: I ensure that the dataset is clean and free of missing data.
- Encoding categorical features: I transform categorical variables into a format suitable for machine learning models.
- Splitting the data: I divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Data scaling and normalization: I perform any necessary transformations to ensure the data is suitable for my chosen algorithms.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

my toolkit includes various machine learning algorithms:

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Elastic Net
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Extra Trees Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor

I use randomized search for hyperparameter tuning to ensure my models perform at their best.

## Deep Learning

Deep learning models are a key part of my approach. I implement these models using TensorFlow and Keras. my deep learning models include fully connected neural networks. I control the training process by specifying the number of epochs and batch sizes.

## Ensemble Learning

To boost my predictive power, I create a voting regressor that combines the predictions of multiple machine learning models.

## Feature Importance

I analyze feature importance using decision tree models. This helps us understand which features have the most impact on my predictions.

## Results

I evaluate my model performance using key metrics:

- R-squared (R2)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

I present the results for different datasets and feature engineering approaches.
